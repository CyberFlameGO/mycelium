# mycelium

> ðŸŒŽ Deploy planet-scale Minecraft server networks on Kubernetes

Mycelium is a Kubernetes controller that enables you to orchestrate and bridge together a large number of Minecraft servers--all with minimal required configuration.

## Installation

```bash
helm repo add mycelium https://harbor.ocf.berkeley.edu/chartrepo/mycelium
kubectl create ns mycelium
helm install mycelium/mycelium -n mycelium
```

## Usage

Create MinecraftProxy CRDs representing proxies, and MinecraftSet CRDs representing servers. All servers with the same `env` and `proxy` labels will be bridged together. Below is a minimal example, but the full spec is available in the docs.

> :warning: The `mycelium.njha.dev/v1alpha1` apiVersion is unstable and may change from release to release, even across minor versions. It will, however, not change across patch versions.

## Internals

### Components

- `mycelium-operator` - A Kubernetes operator that listens for changes to `MinecraftSet` and `MinecraftProxy` CRDs and links them together by creating other Kubernetes objects (like `Service`, `StatefulSet`).
- `mycelium-runner` - A Rust binary that acts as the entrypoint to proxy or game containers. It downloads server jars, plugins, and automatically edits configuration files to work how the operator expects.
- `mycelium-velocity` - A Velocity plugin that 1) provides useful HTTP endpoints for `mycelium-operator` to interact with 2) pings `mycelium-operator` periodically to sync changes 3) collects monitoring information.
- `mycelium-paper` - A PaperMC plugin that 1) exposes useful HTTP endpoints 2) collects monitoring information, exposing it to Kubernetes itself and `mycelium-operator`.

### Goals

Keep in mind this project is in early alpha. This project doesn't meet very many of its goals yet, but, in no particular order...
- cloud native monitoring, tracing, and observability
- fault tolerance with redundant servers, proxies
  - (we're currently looking into dynamically moving players to a new endpoint, resulting in just a minor lag spike if an entire proxy goes down)
- declarative, eventually-consistent server configuration
- speed (minimal convergence time between cluster state and Minecraft state)
- security (encryption backends for secrets, config management, rbac)
